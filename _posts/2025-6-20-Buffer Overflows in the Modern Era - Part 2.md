Welcome to `Part 2` of our Buffer Overflow Series!  I plan on diving in right where we left off last time, so if you just finished `Part 1`, this should all click pretty easily.  Using our trusty `x64dbg` debugger, we determined the memory address within a specific function call that we needed to load in order to execute the calculator.  Now, let's perform an actual buffer overflow and load that same address we referenced in `Part 1`.  

Also I didn't explain this in great detail in `Part 1`, but the address I'm using, `0x14000158C`, is contained within the function call that loads the calculator, and it comes after some assembly instructions that would align the stack according to standard x64 stack alignment convention.  The stack is already aligned before we hijacked this memory address, so I skipped that section of assembly code and moved right to where we needed to be in order to execute the calculator program.  

Here's the python code used to perform a buffer overflow against our vulnerable program.  We're going to do the exact same thing as we did in `Part 1`, but this time, using code instead of manually manipulating memory addresses using the debugger.  We need to send `296 bytes` of data to the program to overflow it and reach the execution pointer.  You can determine the buffer payload using a variety of methods.  I typically just use python and toss junk data at the program until I determine the amount I need to overflow the stack and gain control of `RIP`.  I have the added advantage of knowing the buffer is limited to `275 bytes`, since I wrote the vulnerable program ðŸ˜¸  It usually doesn't take but around 20 - 30 extra bytes added to the original buffer to overflow the stack and reach `RIP`.

```python
import struct
import subprocess

# Offset to the return address
junk = 296  # junk  (304 bytes)

payload = b"\x41" * junk

payload += struct.pack("<Q", 0x14000158C)  

# Run the vulnerable program and supply the payload
process = subprocess.Popen(
    ["C:/Users/robbi/Documents/GitHub/elevationstation_local/overflow3.exe"],  # Replace with the path to your compiled binary
    stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    stderr=subprocess.PIPE
)

#uncomment to allow debugging in x64dbg
input("attach 'overflow.exe' to x64Dbg and press enter when you're ready to continue...")

# Send the payload
stdout, stderr = process.communicate(input=payload)

# Output the program's response
print(stdout.decode())
if stderr:
    print(stderr.decode())
```

Before you run the script, be sure to update this line to reflect your vulnerable program's path and actual name:

 **["C:/Users/robbi/Documents/GitHub/elevationstation_local/overflow3.exe"],  # Replace with the path to your compiled binary**

 
Once you're ready, go ahead and run the python script.  You should see the following:

Open `x64dbg` and click `'Attach'`, and locate your vulnerable program.  Double-click it:

Your program should still have the breakpoints saved and still applied from what you previously set in `Part 1` of this series.  Go ahead and return to your windows cmd prompt and hit `enter` to continue your python script's execution:

Go back to `x64dbg`, and you should see your code execution land here:

Now, hit `F8` two times (`fn + F8` if on laptop).  Your code instruction execution pointer should now be here:

Now, take a look at the bottom right hand corner of your debugger window.  You should see the following:

Okay, so we can see quite a few things at this point:

- Our buffer was successfully placed on the stack
- We have control over what instruction will be executed next
- When we hit `ret`, we will execute the memory address we added to the end of our buffer in our python code!

> I added a reference below if it helps:

```python
junk = 296  # junk  (296 bytes)

payload = b"\x41" * junk

payload += struct.pack("<Q", 0x14000158C) <-- we will be 'returning' to this memory address!
```

So, we will be using return instructions to jump to the memory address of our choosing, hence the name Return Oriented Programming `(ROP)`.  The reason for us using `ret` instructions for executing our code is due to restrictions enabled on modern Windows versions.  The stack does not allow us to change execution (RW-X).  Even if you use the `VirtualProtect` Windows API, the stack remains restrictive toward allowing the execution of assembly instructions we wish to insert onto the stack beyond the original buffer overflow.  This restriction is actually at the hardware level to my knowledge.  DEP is permanently enabled on Windows 11.  I'll demonstrate ways around this in later posts in this series.  It's not easy, but it's certainly possible.

Okay let's move on.  Go ahead and hit `F8` (`function + F8` if on laptop) and you should be here.  This should look familiar to you ðŸ˜¸

You guessed it!  We're in our function call that opens the Windows Calculator.  Continue to hit `'F8'` until you reach the system call that loads the calculator.

Well there you have it.  You were able to once again call a function within the vulnerable program, but this time using an actual buffer overflow!  So far, we've achieved all this while leaving Windows security mechanisms disabled.  That will change in due time, but we still have more to learn before we re-enable those restrictions.  Next up, I'll show you how to start using ROP gadgets to build our full buffer overflow exploit and execute shellcode!  See you then! ðŸ˜º
