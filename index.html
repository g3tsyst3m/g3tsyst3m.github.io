ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the site!<br><br>

First and foremost, I like to keep the focus on learning and responsible research here.  It's exciting to explore offensive security tradecraft, don't get me wrong.  But I'd like to recognize the importance behind responsible use of the techniques and code I share on this blog.  My goal is to enhance security not abuse it.  Okay!  With that little disclaimer out of the way, enjoy your stay and hit me up on discord if you want to learn more about a given topic, etc.<br><br>
