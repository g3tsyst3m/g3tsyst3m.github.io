Security Leader, Security Researcher and Enthusiast.  I'm fairly low profile, but share useful info from time to time.  I've worked in Infosec for over a decade, and have an (ISC)2 CISSP certification.  My programming fluency is centered around Python, PHP, C++, as well as a continued interest in furthering my understanding of x64 assembly.  I enjoy reverse engineering binaries, both statically and dynamically.  I also enjoy learning new programming languages. I will always strive to learn as much as I can surrounding all facets of information Security.  Want to see what I'm studying currently?  Just keep reading this blog and check out my github!  thanks everyone ðŸ˜¸

The focus on this blog will largely be on offensive security tools and malware research. I would eventually like to share detailed, on-demand video walkthroughs, breaking down tools and concepts shared in all my writeups.  All in due time I suppose ðŸ˜¸
