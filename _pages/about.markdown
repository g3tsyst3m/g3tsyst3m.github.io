An Infosec Research and Development blog:

Security Leader, Security Researcher and Enthusiast.  I'm fairly low profile, but share useful info from time to time.  I've worked in Infosec for over a decade, and have an (ISC)2 CISSP certification.  My programming fluency is centered around Python, PHP, C/C++, and x86/x64 assembly.  I've worked in Healthcare and Higher Education most of my career;  the longest time served in  Higher Education where I worked at a Law School for a few years and then moved on to yet another higher education entity where I live, and that's where I remain today.  I've also been involved (and continue to be involved) in freelance/consulting work as the opportunity arises (This blog has helped considerably in that respect).  I will always strive to learn as much as I can surrounding all facets of information Security.  Want to see what I'm studying currently?  Just keep reading this blog and check out my github!  Thanks everyone 😸

The focus on this blog will largely be on offensive security tools and malware research. Outside of the blog, I also share detailed, on-demand video walkthroughs, breaking down tools and concepts shared throughout several of my blog posts via my ko-fi membership. 😸 I also share exclusive content not on my blog via ko-fi.
