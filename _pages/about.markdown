An Infosec Research and Development blog:           

![home](/assets/images/aboutimg.png){:class="img-responsive"}      

Security Leader, Security Researcher and Enthusiast.  I'm fairly low profile, but share useful info from time to time.  I've worked in Infosec ~14+ years, and have an (ISC)2 CISSP certification.  My programming fluency is centered around Python, PHP, C++ (windows APIs and undocumented APIs), as well as a continued interest in furthering my understanding of x86/x64 assembly.  I enjoy reverse engineering binaries, both statically and dynamically.  I also enjoy learning new programming languages.  I like to lead and serve others, but I also like to get my hands dirty and keep my skills fresh with continuing my technical infosec education.  I serve in an executive role in my field, but my strengths will always be geared toward the technical sphere of influence.  This next statement I say this with all humility in check: I find today more than ever, a technical security leader is essential to an organization.  Long gone are the days of simply having a maanger with a CISSP that doesn't have a broad understanding of multiple areas of Cybersecurity.  In my humble opinion, one should strive to learn as many aspects of InfoSec as they can, be it: Network Security, Vulnerability/Pentesting, Cloud based security, programming secure APIs, hardware security, audit and policy/risk, etc!  I will always strive to learn as much as I can surrounding all facets of information Security.  Want to see what I'm studying currently?  Just keep reading this blog and check out my github!  thanks everyone ðŸ˜¸

It is my hopes that we can grow together and help foster a community of avid InfoSec Learners who strive to grow in knowledge of all facets of offensive security. We will focus primarily on offensive security tools and malware research. I would eventually like to share detailed, on-demand video walkthroughs, breaking down tools and concepts shared in all my writeups.  All in due time I suppose ðŸ˜¸

All exploits written in the link above used OllyDbg for x86 reverse engineering.  Exploits are buffer overflow, Structured Event Handler and EIP direct overwrite/ROP 

Co-wrote a Metasploit module:
