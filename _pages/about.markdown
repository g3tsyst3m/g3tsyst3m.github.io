A Infosec Research and Development blog:           

![home](/assets/images/aboutimg.png){:class="img-responsive"}      

Security Researcher and Enthusiast.  I'm fairly low profile, but share useful info from time to time.  Worked in Infosec 10+ years, CISSP.   Red Team wannabe

It is my hopes that we can grow together and help foster a community of avid InfoSec Learners who strive to grow in knowledge of all facets of offensive security. We will focus primarily on red team engagement tools. I will share detailed, on-demand video walkthroughs, breaking down tools and concepts shared in all my writeups.
