**Want to support my work?**

**Ko-Fi:**

Make a one-time donation or choose a membership tier that best suits you!  There's only one membership tier right now so it's very easy to navigate ðŸ˜¸
Click on my ko-fi profile below to learn more!  This is a great way to further compliment the content on my blog with videos/walkthroughs, Q/A with me, livestream content, private discord roles, etc.

I'm always open to partnerships.  If you'd be interested in sponsoring this blog or you'd like for me to give your program / service a shoutout, reach out to me.  I'm always interested in helping elevate and promote top cybersecurity offerings that give back to the community.  

You can reach me at my email address listed both on the left-hand side and footer of my blog, or hop in discord and we can discuss opportunities there as well.  Whatever works for you.  Thanks!
