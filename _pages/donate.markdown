I'm always open to partnerships.  If you'd be interested in sponsoring this blog or you'd like for me to give your program / service a shoutout, reach out to me.  I'm always interested in helping elevate and promote top cybersecurity offerings that give back to the community.  

You can reach me at my email address listed both on the left-hand side and footer of my blog, or hop in discord and we can discuss opportunities there as well.  Whatever works for you.  Thanks!
