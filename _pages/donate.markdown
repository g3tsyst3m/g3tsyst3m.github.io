**Tutoring/Mentorship Program Opportunity**

Yes, I provide Tutoring/Mentorship services!  This is a very personalized and dedicated service I provide that is uniquely different from my KO-FI ☕ membership offering.  The mentorship / tutoring program is a dedicated set of hours applied directly to a learning path of your choosing.  More info below:

**Membership Offering:**

Also, if you ever want to go deeper into any topic I write about, feel free to check out my membership offering as well.  I don't mind helping here and there with quick questions via discord, but I think I owe it to you and myself to spend the proper time it takes to teach you a given topic thoroughly.  That's why I toss that out there.  No pressure, but it's there should anyone ever need it.

The membership details can be found via the link below. Subscribing is a great way to further compliment the content on my blog with videos/walkthroughs, Q/A with me, livestream content, private discord roles, etc.

I'm always open to partnerships.  If you'd be interested in sponsoring this blog or you'd like for me to give your program / service a shoutout, reach out to me.  I'm always interested in helping elevate and promote top cybersecurity offerings that give back to the community.  

You can reach me at my email address listed both on the left-hand side and footer of my blog, or hop in discord and we can discuss opportunities there as well.  Whatever works for you.  Thanks!
